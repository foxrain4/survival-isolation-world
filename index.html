  <h1>Survival Isolation</h1>
  <p><strong>Prehistoric instinct, no modern help.</strong></p>
  <div class="description">
    A stranded world—forest, desert, mountain, or island.<br>
    Tools must be made, food hunted, trust earned.<br>
    Even unarmed humans can be terrifying.<br>
    Survival means becoming raw and real.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔧 What Makes This World Type Unique?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No advanced technology—players must rely on primitive tools or nature itself.</li>
      <li>Danger comes from the environment, hunger, cold, and other people.</li>
      <li>Social dynamics shift quickly—alliances are fragile, betrayal is easy.</li>
      <li>There is no safety net. Failure means death or worse.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌿 Worldbuilding Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with a limited map—an island, mountain basin, or dense jungle.</li>
      <li>Design natural hazards: cliffs, caves, predators, weather, disease.</li>
      <li>Add relics of the past: a crashed plane, an old cabin, or abandoned camps.</li>
      <li>Make survival resources limited—fresh water, edible food, shelter spots.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧠 Narrative Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The group was never meant to survive—was it a setup?</li>
      <li>Strangers bring stories of another group nearby—are they friend or foe?</li>
      <li>The protagonist starts as prey but learns to become a hunter.</li>
      <li>Unspoken history underlies the land—bones, markings, strange rules.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎮 Game Design Possibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Crafting systems based on real-world logic (friction fire, spear tips, snares).</li>
      <li>Mental health mechanics: stress, fear, isolation, hallucinations.</li>
      <li>Inventory decisions matter—do you carry food or firewood?</li>
      <li>Build trust mechanics with other survivors—share or steal?</li>
    </ul>

    Worldbuilding this genre is about stripping everything down to the core: survival, instinct, and the will to adapt.

  <h1>Story</h1>

<div style="height: 40px;"></div>
  
    <h2>🪨 "Ash of the First Fire"</h2>
   <div class="description">
     The crash didn’t echo. It thudded against the mountain like a blunt knife striking flesh—then silence, broken only by the sound of trees snapping like twigs and the slow, lazy drift of fire catching on dry leaves.
<br>Juno woke tangled in nylon and blood. She couldn’t tell whose. Her leg was twisted, the taste of iron in her mouth thick. When she moved, pain blossomed like wildfire. But the pain was good—it meant she was alive.
<br>The others didn’t scream. They didn’t move. Just her and the wind, whispering through pine needles like a language older than anything she knew.
  </div>
  
    <h2>🌲 Week 1: Hunger and Bone</h2>
  <div class="description">
     There were no flares. No radio. No promise of rescue. The sky above the ridgeline cracked open with rain by nightfall, and Juno quickly learned which leaves made her sick, which berries burned her throat, which insects crawled in her boots.
    <br>Her first tool was a shard of plastic from a cracked seatbelt buckle. She wrapped it in bark and twine, cut a branch into a stake. Fire came after three days—dry moss, a rock, and a blistered hand. When it sparked, she wept. Not from joy. From the way it reminded her how alone she truly was.
    <br>She ate a bird raw once. Just once.
  </div>

  <h2>🐾 Week 3: Predator / Prey</h2>
  <div class="description">
     She wasn’t alone.
    <br>On the third morning of frost, she saw footprints by the creek. Not boots. Bare feet. Bigger than hers. Spread toes. She didn’t know if they meant friend or feral. The fire, she began hiding beneath stones. Her food—what little she gathered—was moved nightly.
    <br>On the seventh night, she saw him. Or it. Standing beyond the tree line, a crude spear in hand. He didn’t move. Neither did she. The firelight flickered across his face and she saw something worse than savagery—recognition. As if he knew what she’d become. Or what he once was.
    <br>They didn’t speak.
  </div>

  <h2>⛓️ Week 5: The Pact</h2>
  <div class="description">
     It was hunger that brought them together. Two wolves circling the same dying deer. She offered half. He nodded. He left. Came back the next day with bark soaked in pine resin—good for burning. Over time, they shared nothing but silence and tools. His name, she learned from the cave wall: Gao.
    <br>They taught each other signs. Clenched fists meant storm. Open palms meant safe. Blood on the wrist? Enemy.
    <br>Trust didn’t grow. It clawed.
  </div>

    <h2>🧠 Week 8: The Whispering Bones</h2>
  <div class="description">
     They found bones in the gorge. Not animal. Not fresh. Arranged in circles, etched with slashes and crude symbols. Gao avoided them. Juno didn’t. She found more the deeper she searched—buried beneath cairns, strung from trees. Warnings or rituals, she couldn’t tell.
    <br>There were things in the dark that didn’t make noise. Not wolves. Not people. Sometimes Gao disappeared for days. Returned with no explanation.
    <br>The land wasn’t just harsh. It was watching.
  </div>

      <h2>🔧 Instinct, Not Intelligence</h2>
  <div class="description">
     Juno no longer thought in days or hours. Her calendar became scars. Her clock was the sun bleeding behind black pines. She wore leather stitched from rabbit hide, carried a stone blade polished to a shine. She didn’t dream anymore—only remembered.
    <br>One day, Gao spoke. Just one word: “Run.”
    <br>They didn’t pack. They didn’t ask. They ran from the river valley and never went back. Something followed. Something huge. Something that howled without breath.
