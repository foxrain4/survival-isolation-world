  <h1>Survival Isolation</h1>
  <p><strong>Prehistoric instinct, no modern help.</strong></p>
  <div class="description">
    A stranded worldâ€”forest, desert, mountain, or island.<br>
    Tools must be made, food hunted, trust earned.<br>
    Even unarmed humans can be terrifying.<br>
    Survival means becoming raw and real.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ”§ What Makes This World Type Unique?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No advanced technologyâ€”players must rely on primitive tools or nature itself.</li>
      <li>Danger comes from the environment, hunger, cold, and other people.</li>
      <li>Social dynamics shift quicklyâ€”alliances are fragile, betrayal is easy.</li>
      <li>There is no safety net. Failure means death or worse.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Worldbuilding Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with a limited mapâ€”an island, mountain basin, or dense jungle.</li>
      <li>Design natural hazards: cliffs, caves, predators, weather, disease.</li>
      <li>Add relics of the past: a crashed plane, an old cabin, or abandoned camps.</li>
      <li>Make survival resources limitedâ€”fresh water, edible food, shelter spots.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ§  Narrative Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The group was never meant to surviveâ€”was it a setup?</li>
      <li>Strangers bring stories of another group nearbyâ€”are they friend or foe?</li>
      <li>The protagonist starts as prey but learns to become a hunter.</li>
      <li>Unspoken history underlies the landâ€”bones, markings, strange rules.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸŽ® Game Design Possibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Crafting systems based on real-world logic (friction fire, spear tips, snares).</li>
      <li>Mental health mechanics: stress, fear, isolation, hallucinations.</li>
      <li>Inventory decisions matterâ€”do you carry food or firewood?</li>
      <li>Build trust mechanics with other survivorsâ€”share or steal?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    Worldbuilding this genre is about stripping everything down to the core: survival, instinct, and the will to adapt.

  <h1>Story</h1>

<div style="height: 40px;"></div>
  
    <h2>ðŸª¨ "Ash of the First Fire"</h2>
   <div class="description">
     The crash didnâ€™t echo. It thudded against the mountain like a blunt knife striking fleshâ€”then silence, broken only by the sound of trees snapping like twigs and the slow, lazy drift of fire catching on dry leaves.
<br>Juno woke tangled in nylon and blood. She couldnâ€™t tell whose. Her leg was twisted, the taste of iron in her mouth thick. When she moved, pain blossomed like wildfire. But the pain was goodâ€”it meant she was alive.
<br>The others didnâ€™t scream. They didnâ€™t move. Just her and the wind, whispering through pine needles like a language older than anything she knew.
  </div>
  
    <h2>ðŸŒ² Week 1: Hunger and Bone</h2>
  <div class="description">
     There were no flares. No radio. No promise of rescue. The sky above the ridgeline cracked open with rain by nightfall, and Juno quickly learned which leaves made her sick, which berries burned her throat, which insects crawled in her boots.
    <br>Her first tool was a shard of plastic from a cracked seatbelt buckle. She wrapped it in bark and twine, cut a branch into a stake. Fire came after three daysâ€”dry moss, a rock, and a blistered hand. When it sparked, she wept. Not from joy. From the way it reminded her how alone she truly was.
    <br>She ate a bird raw once. Just once.
